# Focused directive: prediction shrinks the CIX possibility space

The Silesia first-place objective remains active. The user's latest directive
centres research on PAQ-quality prediction plus conditional CIX representations,
with feedback from CIX structural state to prediction. The decisive question is
whether identical predictive information yields fewer physical bytes through a
smaller residual possibility space. Merely changing the entropy coder does not
demonstrate this hypothesis.

Required directions include conditional multinomials, ranked candidate sets,
inside/outside membership, successes versus exceptions, composition residuals,
context-dependent alphabet partitions and ranks, match removal, transformed
residuals, runs/distances/tokens/fields, hierarchical elimination, recursive
residuals, representation mixtures, and joint model-selection/residual costs.
Reverse feedback includes block compositions, remaining-count deficits,
occupancy, rank prefixes, local entropy, and previous residual composition.

## First controlled experiment

`build_paq_prediction_bridge.py` builds an isolated copy of v215. The reference
binary and all running reference experiments remain untouched. The bridge records
the exact probability and outcome for every coded bit, including block headers
and transformed substreams. A traced archive must be byte-identical to the
ordinary PAQ archive before any result is accepted.

`paq_cix_residual.py` partitions prediction failures by deterministic confidence
bins. It transmits every bin length and failure count. Knowing these counts
restricts the arrangement space to the product of binomial coefficients,
instead of all binary masks. It compares:

1. Original PAQ arithmetic coding, unchanged predictions.
2. Exact integer ranks inside each conditional type class.
3. Arithmetic coding with the identical remaining-count constraint.

The third control matters: any improvement from paid composition knowledge is
separate from a benefit of enumerative ranks themselves. Quantizing confidence
also discards predictive detail, so a loss can reveal quantization or metadata
cost rather than disprove all prediction-constrained CIX designs.

The decoder reads only the CIX frame, reconstructs residual streams, and runs the
PAQ model causally to recover the source. It has no original input, saved
prediction trace, or oracle probability stream. PAQ transforms and model updates
remain in effect. The uncompressed intermediate residual file is decoder work
space, generated entirely from the counted CIX frame.

Record raw coded-event uncertainty, PAQ cross-entropy, conditional combinatorial
uncertainty, composition metadata, physical output, encode/decode time, hashes,
source/binary revisions, and exact restoration. Prefix results are diagnostics,
never full-corpus ranks. Retain original PAQ/CIX streams whenever a candidate loses.

Next refinements depend on these measurements: richer probability-preserving
partitions, smaller context-conditioned candidate alphabets, structural match
removal, and remaining-count feedback. No claim of superiority or disproof is
made before the controlled runs complete.
